Fortunately, writing better Python code

Fortunately, writing better Python code isn’t hard. As a precursor to this know, I encourage you to choose a well-accepted style guide if our goal is to write better code. Style guides help you stick to a format, making it easier to read code written by people on your team – and your own code, as well! I personally prefer “The Hitchhiker’s Guide To Python.” It’s extensive and well written.
